# FakeButtonAndroidChallenge
Android Intern Coding Challenge @ Button

This application was created to implement the following functionality that exercises a REST-ful API:

The home screen should show a list of all users (i.e. the response to a GET to /user).
From this screen, you should also be able to create a new user.

Therefore, the implementation has 2 functions.
Function 1: Create User (by name, email, and candidate parameter).
Function 2: List User (by candidate parameter).

The intent of this implementation was to verify the functionality between it and the REST-ful API, therefore it only enforces minimal styling and error checking (for user inputs).

Implementation uses Retrofit - a type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java by Square, Inc.
